# libft_updated
This is an updated libft library

This project involves creating my own library with representations of standard functions from the libc library and additional functions that are not in libc but are useful for working with linked lists represented as structs. The library is built using a Makefile from all the files in this project.

This library will be updated in the future.

### Usage
To use this library, include "libft.h" in your code and link the created libft.a file when compiling your program.

### Addition features
- representation of printf and fprintf;
- get_next_line function returns a string until '\n' or '\0';
- ft_abs function returns absolute value of integer;
- ft_free_strs function frees a memory that was allocated.
